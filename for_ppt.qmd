## Research Background

### Global OTT Platforms and Cultural Barriers

<hr>

-   Emergence of global OTTs: `Netflix`, `Disney+`, etc.

-   Lowering cultural barriers in media consumption

-   Examples:

    -   Korean TV shows: `Squid Game`, `Extraordinary Attorney Woo` [@cnn2022attorneywoo]

    -   US-based show: `Strange Things` [@hollywoodreporter2022strangerthings]

-   However, **Global mega-hits still rare**, often a matter of serendipity

## Research Background

### **Local Media Channels and OTTs - `Challenges`**
<hr>

-   Global OTTs threaten local media channels

-   Local OTTs emerge to counter competition

-   Main challenges for local OTTs:

    1.  Producing culturally appropriate content with global mega-hit
        potential

    2.  Renting overseas content that appeals to local users [@wang2023influential]

## Research Background
### **Strategies for Local OTT Success**

<hr>


-   Addressing purchasing priority and cost-effectiveness

-   Creating high-quality content with worldwide resonance [@kim2022theorizing]

-   Catering to local user preferences

-   Latecomer local OTT operators need additional strategies

![](img/fig_3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Problem Description

<hr>


-   Previous research on OTT strategies [@park2019research]

    -   Localization, Partnership, Content differentiation, Revenue enhancement, Service optimization 

-   Local OTT providers adopt a multi-faceted approach

    -   Assessing demand and establishing partnerships [@wang2023influential]

        -   Acquiring content similar in genre and quality to Netflix and Disney+

    -   Developing local content repositories using local/regional languages
        [@sharma2023ott]
    
        -   Forming strategic collaborations with: Mobile network companies, Financial institutions, Technology companies


<br>

**Research Gap**

-   Limited understanding of OTT launching strategies considering:

    -   `Compatibility` between movies and countries

-   Need for more research on country-specific content and strategies



## Research Questions & Goal


<hr>

<br>

**Research Questions**

-   How do content and country relationships impact popularity?

-   How can accurate measurements of relatedness improve content
    consumption patterns?

<br>

**Research Goal**

-   Propose a method to measure ***movie-country relatedness density***

-   Test the importance of the ***movie-country relatedness*** in predicting ***movie popularity*** in
    specific countries

-   Develop ***a local OTT strategy*** based on movie-country relatedness




## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**The Complexity of the Cultural Industry**

-   Cultural goods difficult to express as utility function (Throsby 2001)

-   Cultural industry sectors:

    -   Media

    -   Fashionable consumer goods

    -   Services

    -   Creative professions

    -   Collective cultural consumption institutions (Scott 2004)

*Recommended picture: A collage of various cultural industry elements
(e.g., film, music, architecture, art).*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Cultural Sensitivity in International Trade**

-   Content carries cultural messages (Fejes 1981)

-   Protection of local content from other markets

-   Cultural goods deeply rooted in their place of origin (Demont‐Heinrich

    2011) 

-   Globalization and multicultural companies impact the cultural economy

*Recommended picture: A map with arrows showing the flow of cultural goods
between countries, indicating the sensitivity of international trade in
cultural goods.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Cultural Similarity and Content-Country Compatibility**

-   Importance of cultural similarity in adopting foreign content (Dwyer et
    al. 2018, Jang et al. 2023, Kim 2022, Sharma and Lulandala 2023)

-   Shared cultural attributes due to content globalization

-   Special content--country compatibility beyond cultural differences

-   Borrowing the concept of product--country compatibility from economic
    geography (Hausmann and Hidalgo 2010)

*Recommended picture: A Venn diagram showing the overlap of cultural
similarity and content-country compatibility.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Product-Country Compatibility**

-   Concept from economic geography

-   Considers cultural, economic, and regulatory conditions (Asheim and
    Isaksen 2002)

-   Impacts a product's success in a target market

-   Compatibility evaluated through relatedness (Jun et al. 2020)

    1.  Product relatedness

    2.  Importer relatedness

    3.  Exporter relatedness

*Recommended picture: A diagram illustrating the three dimensions of
relatedness (product, importer, and exporter).*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**The Importance of Product-Country Compatibility**

-   Widely recognized in international business and economic geography
    (Cavusgil et al. 2014)

-   Culturally aligned products more likely to succeed

-   Compatibility with economic and regulatory environment leads to
    profitability

*Recommended picture: A graph showing the relationship between
product-country compatibility and product success in a foreign market.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Applying Product-Country Compatibility to Content**

-   Adapting the concept for content-country compatibility

-   Assessing cultural, economic, and regulatory fit for content in target
    countries

-   Potential to improve the success of content in foreign markets

*Recommended picture: A split image, with one side showing a product and
its compatibility with a country, and the other side showing content and
its compatibility with a country, illustrating the connection between the
two concepts.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Content-Country Compatibility**

-   Adaptation of product-country compatibility for movies and TV shows

-   Considers cultural, economic, and regulatory conditions

-   Impacts success and profitability of content in target markets

*Recommended picture: A diagram illustrating the factors that contribute to
content-country compatibility (cultural, economic, and regulatory
conditions).*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Importance of Content-Country Compatibility**

-   Aligns with research on product-country compatibility

-   Successful content aligns with a country's cultural norms, values, and
    legal framework

-   Examples: local actors, settings, themes

*Recommended picture: A collage of successful movies and TV shows in
various countries, illustrating the importance of content-country
compatibility.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Factors Influencing Content-Country Compatibility**

-   Cultural factors: language, humor, storytelling style

-   Economic factors: disposable income, streaming service accessibility

-   Regulatory factors: censorship laws, import/export regulations

-   Complex interplay of factors in evaluating potential success

*Recommended picture: A Venn diagram showing the overlap of cultural,
economic, and regulatory factors influencing content-country
compatibility.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br>

**Summary**

-   Content-country compatibility crucial for international expansion

-   Align content with target country's cultural, economic, and regulatory
    conditions

-   Increases likelihood of success in international business endeavors

*Recommended picture: A globe with arrows pointing to various countries,
symbolizing the international expansion of content and the importance of
content-country compatibility.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br> **Measuring Content-Movie Compatibility**

-   Use relatedness density index to measure content-movie compatibility

-   Equation (1) for calculating content-country related density
    (〖RD〗\_(r,i))

-   Considers co-occurrence of top-tiered lists to measure relatedness
    (∅\_(i,j))

*Recommended picture: A diagram illustrating the calculation of
content-country related density using the relatedness density index.*

## Theoretical Foundations

<br> **Variation in Movies and TV Shows**

-   Movies and TV shows vary in themes, characters, cultural references

-   Impacts compatibility with specific countries due to diverse cultural
    norms, values, preferences

*Recommended picture: A collage of movies and TV shows with varying themes,
characters, and cultural references to illustrate the diversity in
content.*

## Hypothesis

<br>

**Hypothesis 1**

-   H1: Movies and TV shows exhibit varying degrees of compatibility with
    different countries

-   Compatibility predicts a given country's likelihood of including
    content in its top 20 list

*Recommended picture: A bar chart showing varying degrees of compatibility
for different movies and TV shows across different countries, illustrating
the hypothesis.*

## Hypothesis

<br>

**Hypothesis 2**

-   Importance of content-country compatibility acknowledged

-   Global mega-hit content occasionally becomes popular across various
    countries, regardless of compatibility

-   Factors contributing to widespread popularity: effective marketing,
    favorable media coverage, word-of-mouth recommendations

-   Hypothesis 2: Ubiquity of popular content predicts a given country's
    likelihood of including that content in its top 20 list

*Recommended picture: A world map showing the widespread popularity of a
global mega-hit movie or TV show, illustrating the hypothesis.*

## Methods
